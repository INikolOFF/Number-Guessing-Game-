It is designed as practice for beginners, helping them understand:
	•	how to use functions
	•	how to work with lists
	•	handling user input
	•	using loops and conditional statements

The code is commented and easy to follow.

  Future improvements (optional ideas)
✓	•	Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
✓	•	Add a scoring system based on attempts
	•	Add time tracking for each game
	•	Save game statistics to a file
